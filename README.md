# Student Stress Monitoring

**Analyzing Student Stress Levels using Machine Learning and Data Analytics**

This project focuses on monitoring and analyzing student stress by combining stress indicators, well-being factors, underlying causes, and their impacts. The goal is to understand patterns, identify key stress drivers, and provide insights for intervention.

## Features

- **Dataset Overview:** Two datasets covering stress levels and related factors such as anxiety, depression, academic performance, social support, and lifestyle.  
- **Data Quality Assessment:** Checks for missing values, duplicates, and basic statistics.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis  
  - Correlation analysis and multicollinearity detection  
  - Outlier detection and visualization  
- **Feature Importance:**  
  - Mutual information analysis  
  - Dimensionality reduction using PCA  
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  - Normality tests  
  - ANOVA to detect significant differences in features across stress levels  
- **Machine Learning Preparation:**  
  - Feature scaling, handling multicollinearity, and outlier treatment  
  - Recommendations for feature selection, feature engineering, and class imbalance handling  

## Libraries Used

- Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`  
- Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Statistical Analysis: `scipy`  
- Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`  

## Potential Applications

- Early identification of high-stress students  
- Data-driven strategies for student well-being programs  
- Academic and lifestyle interventions based on predictive insights
